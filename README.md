# PowerBI_BankTransaction_project
Bank Transactions Report Project :
Data Set & Objective : This Power BI project focuses on analyzing bank transactions to monitor performance and detect potential fraud. The dataset includes transaction ID, type, status, amount, fraud flag, bandwidth group, and network slice details. The dashboard is structured into three main sections: Bank Transaction Report, Fraud Detection and Transaction Details.

Key visuals : Key visuals include total transaction and fraud counts, transaction status breakdown (success vs. failed), fraud percentage (48.1%), and distribution by type (transfer, deposit, withdrawal). Time-series analysis highlights transaction peaks between 10:15 AM and 11:00 AM. Fraudulent activities are further explored through visuals by bandwidth group, network slice, and region.

Insights: Notably, the 150â€“250 Mbps bandwidth group and Slice2 network show the highest number of frauds. These insights can help financial institutions improve fraud detection models, optimize network monitoring, and prioritize risk mitigation strategies.
